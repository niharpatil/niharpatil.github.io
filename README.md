## I'm Nihar! 
I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](http://www.nets.upenn.edu/). NETS is an offshoot of Computer Science with a focus on networked systems
and distributed applications.

I'll keep my bio pretty brief. My mission in life is to help as many people as possible with technology.
It's why I started [Penn Tech Review](http://www.penntechreview.com), to tell the stories of people making transformative impacts in technology. Soon enough, my team and I will build the largest database of inspiring
profiles in technology. 

Anyway, my interests include web development, JavaScript (if that counts as an interest), and playing the guitar.
